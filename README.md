# üì´ How to Use

To use this template, you can download it from the releases, as they are bug-approved and fixed versions! After downloading, extract the zip file to a folder and modify the whole body [HTML] for what you need. If you want more advanced features and don't have the knowledge, I recommend hiring a developer to do it for you.

# üîí API

To add the checkout system with payment methods, you can use the cookies that are created when the user logs in to generate payment APIs. Here is what cookies are and how you can get them using JavaScript:

```js
const loggedCookie = getCookieValue('logged');
console.log(loggedCookie);

const userCookie = getCookieValue('nickname');
console.log(userCookie);
```
# üéØ Considerations

> The project includes a preview of a login and registration system. This system was implemented using JavaScript, as mentioned earlier, and is only a preview. It is essential to adapt or remove this system for your own project, as it was added because it was a requirement for the college project.

> The Checkout system was not added, as it would require backend integration and other considerations that were out of the scope of this project.

> If you wish to implement advanced features such as a functional login or checkout system, it is recommended to hire a developer or add backend functionality yourself.
